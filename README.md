# Mini Twitter Node Version

## Demos

- To run the app please run npm restore in both mini-twitter-app and mini-twitter-ui directories.
- The server and the front-end will need to be run separately (although they work together)
- Both run by running the npm start command in the directories.

## Assumptions made

- There are users with the same names
- All entries in the files are separated by a newline character
- Users see their own tweets in their feeds
- The input files will be formatted correctly

## Thanks

Thanks for giving me a really interesting challenge, I felt like kid learning how to code for the first time.

It took me about 7 hours to produce this mess but I enjoyed every moment... through my tears haha

I'm missing proper error handling as well as unit tests on this on.
